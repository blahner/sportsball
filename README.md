Code for a html/css/avascript bracket generator website and python bracket analysis scripts.

This code is specifically written for a 64 team tournament bracket (like NCAA's college basketball march madness) but can
be adapted to other tournament styles. At the click of a button, the website automatically fills out a good bracket, 
assigns it a bracket name, and proposes a tiebreaker score. Each click creates a unique bracket. The analysis code
computes how well 3 million brackets would have scored in previous years of the tournament and compares it to other 
bracket prediction methods (see the blog post below).
